{"reportId":"20260114","title":"The Daily Marketing Signal","dateRange":"January 13, 2026 - January 14, 2026","summary":"This reporting period reveals a sharply polarized gaming market. Hytale's Early Access launch triggered a platform-wide phenomenon, topping Twitch with over 420K concurrent viewers and surging search volumes—proof that the sandbox genre still dominates. Meanwhile, BioWare officially shut down Anthem, cementing its status as a cautionary tale for live-service failures. Arc Raiders crossed 12.4 million units sold, solidifying its position as the leader in the extraction shooter space. IP-driven marketing continues to fire on all cylinders: Marvel Rivals claimed YouTube Gaming's #1 spot with its Deadpool character reveal, Lego Pokemon rumors sparked a 600% search spike, and Resident Evil Requiem announced an upcoming Showcase. Regional differences are stark: North America gravitates toward core gameplay-driven AAA titles and influencer-led trends, while Japan's market is dominated by live operations—Touken Ranbu's 11th anniversary topped Twitter trends, and pachinko machine videos dominated YouTube rankings. Industry focus centers on the life-or-death stakes of live-service games and AI technology controversies, as the market navigates a critical inflection point between old and new paradigms.","sections":[{"id":"new-games","title":"Game Monitoring","subsections":[{"title":"New Releases","type":"card-grid","items":[{"title":"Hytale","tags":["New Release","Sandbox RPG","Early Access","Breakout Hit"],"content":[{"label":"Game Overview","text":"Developed by Hypixel Studios, this sandbox RPG is hailed as Minecraft's most formidable challenger.
