    "summary": "This period in the gaming market is characterized by typical transition phase hardware features and a trust crisis in service-oriented games. While Nintendo Switch 2 received high attention, holiday sales fell short of the original model, with Nintendo citing a lack of major Western titles. 'Mario Tennis Fever' attempted to boost confidence as one of the first first-party titles, but players were disappointed by the lack of innovation. Xbox's cross-platform strategy deepened further, with 'Avowed' confirmed for PlayStation, sparking intense discussion among console players.",

Players utilize terrain and character skill synergies in semi-open levels, emphasizing industrialized base building and exploration. The art style continues the IP's cool tones, but modeling precision and movement smoothness are key feedback points from current tests."
