{"reportId":"20260116","title":"The Daily Marketing Signal","dateRange":"January 15 - January 16, 2026","summary":"This reporting period reveals a dual trend of legacy IP resurgence and deepening cross-media integration in the gaming market. Resident Evil: Requiem ignited cross-platform buzz with Leon's return and classic difficulty settings, while Animal Crossing generated 20K+ searches from mere quality-of-life updates like jumping, demonstrating the community stickiness of evergreen titles. The Fallout IP expanded from TV series to reality competition shows, complemented by Magic: The Gathering crossover cards, showcasing successful IP diversification into broader entertainment. On the technical front, Monster Hunter Wilds faced intense PC player backlash over DLC detection mechanisms affecting frame rates, potentially escalating into a PR crisis. Regional market differences are pronounced: U.S. players focus on technical details and consumer rights, while the Japanese market deeply integrates offline partnerships (McDonald's × Dragon Quest) and VTuber ecosystems. Mobile AAA migration is evident, with Civilization VII landing on Apple Arcade marking further penetration of hardcore strategy games into mobile platforms.","sections":[{"id":"new-games","title":"Game Monitoring","subsections":[{"title":"New Release Updates","type":"game-cards","items":[]},{"title":"Top Game Monitoring","type":"game-cards","items":[{"title":"Resident Evil: Requiem","tags":["Trending","Survival Horror","Console"],"content":[{"label":"Game Updates","text":"Capcom hosted a Showcase event this period, unveiling gameplay footage for Resident Evil: Requiem.
